Welcome to my ToDo List!

This is a very simple, straightforward project I made in Qt for practice with assembling widgets into a functional system, as well
as learning how to use the QSettings object.

The item.h and item.cpp files are used to create "Tasks", which encapsulate each Task's name, priority, time, date, and notes.

The todolist.h and todolist.cpp files are used to initialize a single ToDo_List, which holds all of the user's tasks. It can add, remove, 
and sort tasks (to sort, click onto any background space (anywhere not editable) and simply press 'r'. This function immediately sorts the
tasks in descending order by their priority level. Altering what the program sorts by is a very easy change.)

main.cpp simply inits the main Widget (of type ToDoList) and begins the program.

There you have it, that simple! I made this entirely from scratch as a test of how much progress I've made in the little time I've spent
in Qt. I feel confident in my abilities to make something more complex after having completed this task.

Thanks for reading!
